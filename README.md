Academic project conducted during my first year at ENSAE 

<!-- MAIN IDEA -->

This code proposes a generator of Tweets based on  Markov chains of order 1 and 2. It aims to generate tweets in the "style" of a given twitter account. 

<!-- UTILISATION -->

- ```Scrapping_twitter.py``` It presents a code to scrape the tweets of a given twitter account. This will constitute the data base to train our model.
